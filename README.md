# SeleniumExcel
Selenium Automation on Firefox using C# and Excel

This project was done to specifically solve some tasks I was given to understand how Selenium works and practice C# programming.

**Note**: This project may be a bit rough around the edges and that's fine because this is one of the first times I've used C#
to develop something.

For this project we have 3 classes (so far):

* **Program.cs**: The main class and the one where we will be checking which actions we're supposed to execute as specified inside
the Excel file we want to work with. 
* **Support.cs**: This class is the one we'll be using whenever we want to execute a specific action inside our Excel file. 
* **LibExcel_epp**: This class uses the EPPlus package to execute the actions related to Excel. As such, here we will find ways to
create a workbook, worksheet, to iterate through rows, columns, etc. 

This project will be improving constantly and changing stuff as I'm learning how to use both Selenium and C#.
